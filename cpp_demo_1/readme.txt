Demo of basic OpenCV image loading, displaying, and processing (no shape detection yet).
A good 50% of this program is just useless animation that I added in because it looked cool.

To run the demo:
1) Open a command prompt window in the "cpp_demo_1" folder (in Windows: hold shift, right click, select "open command window here")
2) Type or paste in "HelloOpenCV.exe testimage2.png" and press Enter
3) Wait for the window to load
4) Press any key to begin

You can also try it with "testimage1.jpg", but be warned, the final result will be much much worse. This is why bright green LEDs are so important.
